# Tentris

## Mission
We offer intelligent storage and analytics solutions for knowledge graphs. Our proprietary algorithms achieve up to 1000 times faster query processing. Therewith, we can reduce your computational costs and your CO2 footprint up to 100-fold. The proprietary algorithms in Tentris have already been deployed succesfully in verticals such as chemistry, pharmacy, and Industry 4.0. Try our product demos here to get an idea of the modules we offer.  Contact us to know more.

## Tentris Suite 
Our suite consists of three modules.
    
+ Tentris - Your data in good hands: With Tentris, we offer a natively polylingual storage solution for knowledge graphs that can be queried with SPARQL and GraphQL. Our data structures, processing and data compression algorithms were designed specifically for graphs. This allows Tentris to scale easily to billions of triples on commodity hardware.  Equipped with (custom) data ingestion modules, it can be ported to your data infrastructure in no time,  thus saving you time and money both at deployment and execution time.  Of course, we also offer Tentris as a software-as-a-service solution. Try the demo here. 
+ DRILL - The AI you understand: Imagine an AI that tells you and your team why it suggests a certain classification. That is the essence of DRILL. Our approaches offers natural-language explanations its classification results and hence full algorithmic transparency for your team. Our specialized hybrid learning techniques ensure efficiency and effectiveness while learning at scale and that even on inconsistent data. By providing ante-hoc globally explainable machine learning, DRILL is the first GDPR-conform solution for learning on large-scale knowledge graphs.Try the demo here. 
+ DEMBE - Rapid embedding suite: Want to use your knowledge with classical machine learning algorithms? No problem! We offer the fastest hardware-agnostic suite for computing knowledge graph embeddings. While the suite can easily be configured by your experts for your use cases, it can also self-configure to deliver the best possible embeddings with minimal effort. Try the demo here.
